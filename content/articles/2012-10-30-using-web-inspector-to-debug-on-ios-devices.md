iOS 6 included many updates for Safari, one of which was the Web Inspector which allows you to debug mobile websites in the same way you're used to for normal websites using Firebug or Inspect Element or the equivalent in other browsers.

Web Inspector takes a small amount of setup to get going, but once it is you can browse the code being delivered to your device on your desktop, debug and hot swap code and see the result on the actual device in real time.

## Setup Web Inspector<

### 1. Enable Web Inspector on your iOS Device

[Settings] -&gt; [Safari] -&gt; [Advanced] -&gt; [Web Inspector] switch to on
