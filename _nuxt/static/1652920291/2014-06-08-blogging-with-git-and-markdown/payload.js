I trashed my Wordpress blog. In fact I trashed the entire shared hosting account it was on. I wrote a quick PHP script to pull all my posts out of the Wordpress database and spit them out as Markdown files, I setup Route53 and pointed my nameservers there, fired up an Ubuntu EC2 instance, installed Apache2, a bare Git repository with a post-receive hook that checks commits out into the document root of Apache2 and wrote a quick and dirty index.php that scans for and displays the Markdown files."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"For me, this is a far easier far more flexible way of publishing blog content than any blog \u002F CMS package I've used.  Instead of firing up the WP dashboard and mucking around in Tiny MCE to get my content ready to publish, I just fire up whatever editor I feel like, write my post in Markdown, add and commit the new file and push to my EC2 remote. And seeing as HTML is valid Markdown, if there's ever anything that needs to be marked up, it's extremely easy to just write it right in with the rest of the post. It's not for everybody, it's not even for every developer, but for me this is the best."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:l,props:{id:g},children:[{type:b,tag:m,props:{ariaHidden:n,href:"#to-recap-this-is-my-blog",tabIndex:o},children:[{type:b,tag:p,props:{className:[q,r]},children:[]}]},{type:a,value:i}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:s,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Route53 DNS"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Ubuntu on EC2 instance"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Apache2 and PHP"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Bare remote Git repo on EC2 instance"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"post-receive hook on remote repo"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"index.php with some basic file system and string manipulation code (total 34 lines of PHP)"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Parsedown.php"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"style.css"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"bunch of Markdown files"}]},{type:a,value:c}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:l,props:{id:j},children:[{type:b,tag:m,props:{ariaHidden:n,href:"#make-it-better",tabIndex:o},children:[{type:b,tag:p,props:{className:[q,r]},children:[]}]},{type:a,value:k}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"I'm happy with this for now, but by its nature it's a quick and dirty solution.
