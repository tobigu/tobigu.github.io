Of course things are a little different with Responsive Web Design, fixed-width is an incompatible concept; but the process of designing the PSD was pretty much the same for me in this instance (maybe that will change in time.) I started with a standard desktop design, then created a new project for the mobile design and copied in elements from the original and arranged it all into a logical design. The mobile version was simply used as a guide, there was no need for \"slicing\" from it and my tablet sized viewports breakpoint was just a logical rearranging between these 2 designs. I'd be interested to know how agencies with rigidly defined roles between designer and front end developer are handling this."}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:l,props:{id:w},children:[{type:a,tag:e,props:{ariaHidden:f,href:"#breakpoints",tabIndex:g},children:[{type:a,tag:h,props:{className:[i,j]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:x}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"From what I read on the web before starting my responsive redesign, there were more or less 2 schools of thoughts on breakpoints.
